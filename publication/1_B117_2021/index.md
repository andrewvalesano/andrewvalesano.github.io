abstract: The first cluster of SARS-CoV-2 cases with lineage B.1.1.7 in the state of Michigan was identified through intensive university-led surveillance sampling and targeted sequencing. A collaborative investigation and response was conducted by the local and state health departments, and the campus and athletic medicine COVID-19 response teams, using S-gene target failure screening and rapid genomic sequencing to inform containment strategies. A total of 50 cases of B.1.1.7-lineage SARS-CoV-2 were identified in this outbreak, which was due to three coincident introductions of B.1.1.7-lineage SARS-CoV-2, all of which were genetically distinct from lineages which later circulated in the broader community. This investigation demonstrates the successful implementation of a genomically-informed outbreak response which can be extended to university campuses and other settings at high risk for rapid emergence of new variants.
